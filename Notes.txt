You can make 2 modules work together using the require function.
You can export multiple things by wrapping it inside objects
 
There are 2 types of module pattern : CJS and MJS
Common JS Modules known as CJS
  In CJS we use module.exports and require. CJS is by default used by Node.
  CJS is a older way. In CJS when we rquire modules it requires all the modules in a synchronous way(line after line).
  In CJS the code is executed in non strict mode
 
 
ES Modules also known as MJS
  It has different way of importing and exporting modules. Here we use import and export. By default used in React.
  MJS is a newer way.
  In MJS code is executed in strict mode. In strict mode we cannot write variables without using var let const

Database
It is a organized collection of data. With the help of DBMS we can talk with the Database(like selecting data, fetching data)

Types of Database
  Relational Database - MySql, Postgres
  No Sql - MongoDB
  In memory DB - Redis
  Cloud DB - Amazon RDS

RAM and ROM - RAM is a faster memory but cannot store more amount of data

Types of NoSQL DB are Document DB, Key value DB, Graph DB, Wide column DB, Multimodel DB
MongoDB is s Document DB - It stores data in json format. No need of Joins and Data normalization

Data in MongoDB may look like this
  {
    "name":"John",
    "age":"25",
    "city":"New York",
    "hobbies":["Reading","Swimming","Coding"]
  },
  {
    "name":"John",
    "age":"25",
    "city":"New York",
    "hobbies":["Reading","Swimming","Coding"]
  }

Relational DB store data in Table format

Self managed and One is the Compnay manages the Database for us.
We dont need to worry about deploying our Database to the server when we go for production.
We dont need to ensure that it is always up and running etc

I am having a Database , now i am asking MongoDB company to manage the Database for me, so the company will take the cluster and deploy it on some machine
Always go with the M0 plan(It is free)

How do we use our Cluster
	You need to get a connection string, to connect to the database

MongoDB Compass will help you to get access of the Database. It is the UI for the Database
